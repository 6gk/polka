I have made subtle changes to the fonts in this dir, with the exception of
font.bdf, which I made myself.

## Fira Mono

License: Open Font License

Changes: Make `+` and `*` more distinct, slightly bolder

## Roboto Mono

License: Apache License, Version 2.0

Changes: Slightly bolder and cleaner at 10px on a 96dpi screen
